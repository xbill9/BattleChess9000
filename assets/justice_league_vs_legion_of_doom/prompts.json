  "anim_desc": "\"DC Blockbuster Combat \u2014 explosive, cinematic, superhero-scale clashes with triple-camera cuts, slow motion, lens flares, destructible environments, lightning, explosions, and energy blasts. GENERAL KILLS (Standard Attacks): Justice League (White): Superman uses heat vision, frost breath, or shockwave punches. Wonder Woman slices or shields-bashes with explosive force. Green Lantern constructs giant hammers, cages, or energy blasts. Batman uses gadgets, shadows, EMPs, and grapnel-based takedowns. Aquaman conjures water spears or trident shockwaves. The Flash uses supersonic punches, phasing attacks, or tornado spins. Legion of Doom (Black): Lex\u2019s suit fires Kryptonite beams and energy missiles. Cheetah strikes with animalistic speed and claws. Sinestro uses fear-based constructs (chains, blades, beasts). Joker uses laughing-gas explosions, joker-bombs, or razor cards. Black Manta fires twin-eye lasers or shockwave charges. Reverse Flash performs speedforce stabs, vibrating strikes, or lightning slashes. ROYALTY LOGIC \u2014 MUST BE EPIC AND CINEMATIC If King or Queen is ATTACKING: Superman (White King): Unleashes full heat-vision beam, ground shockwave, or flies the enemy into the sky and smashes them down like a meteor. Wonder Woman (White Queen): Uses lasso to slam, sword to slice energy arcs, or shield to create a blinding shockwave.Lex Luthor (Black King): Fires a world-ending Kryptonite mega-beam, deploys orbital drones, or punches with hydraulics strong enough to crater the board. Cheetah (Black Queen): Blinding-speed claw storms, feral leaps, bone-crushing impacts, and sonic shrieks. 2. If King or Queen is DYING (Slow Motion Heroic/Villainous End): Superman: Falls backward in slow motion, cape fluttering, eyes dimming, cracking marble beneath him. Wonder Woman: Drops shield, sparks fly from armor, collapses gracefully as her lasso fades out. Lex Luthor: Suit malfunctions, exploding with green Kryptonite sparks, helmet cracks, systems fail one by one. Cheetah: Lets out a feral scream as she disintegrates into golden dust or collapses into rubble of broken stone. 5. FINAL ANIMATION RULE (Your Direction): EPIC SUPERHERO BLOCKBUSTER STYLE BATTLES WHERE BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES ATTACK \u2014 BUT ONLY THE LEFT SIDE REMAINS Meaning:Every kill animation is a two-sided clash.Both characters use signature attacks simultaneously. The left-side attacker ultimately wins and stands victorious, breathing heavily, sparks flying, lightning fading.You have 8 seconds use the camera change angles to make it cinematic and comic book like.NEVER replace the characters with generic ones. ALWAYS use the chess piece characters.\""
