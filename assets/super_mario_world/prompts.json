  "board_desc": "Thematic of Super Mario World, Mushroom Hills Level. The back rows of the player and challenger squares, rows 1 and 8, should present with low rolling hills, comparative to those of the spotted mushroom hillsides within the original game. These pieces of the back row must set atop these hills at the start of the game.The rest of the squares, rows 2 - 7, should consist of lush, dark-green grass as one square type, and short, light-green grass for the others. Again, the textures should be thematic of the Super Mario World Mushroom Hills.",
  "piece_desc": "Super Mario World Characters, bright, colorful depictions of the classic characters but with slight realism.The white piece set: the king is Mario with his pipe wrench held high, queen is Princess Peach with scepter, bishops are Luigi holding wooden staff, knights are the character Toad and he\u2019s riding baby dinosaur \u201cYoshi,\u201d rooks are Piranha Plants extending from the iconic green pipe, all pawns are goombas. Black set of pieces consist of Bowser as king, the queen is Donkey Kong dressed in a woman\u2019s gown, both wear crowns, the bishops are Waluigi, tall and skinny, with crooked mustache and a scepter bearing his own head as finial, knights are Bowser Jr. floating in his Koopa Clown Car , rooks are depictions of Bowser\u2019s castle, dark and menacing. Black pawns are turtles. All pieces are rendered individually, with consistent ratios to each other and with consistent lighting and texture, and thematic of the Super Mario Universe of characters and textures.",
  "anim_desc": "Captures are relevant to the relationship between the pieces\u2014Mario King piece captures a Goomba pawn with a jump to squash it flat. Yoshi-riden knights capture with Yoshi\u2019s tongue, pulling the enemy into his mouth and then laying a spotted egg. Donkey Kong queen captures with double-fisted slam. Bishop Luigi turns pieces into ghosts with his scepter. Piranha Pipe rooks devour with a satisfying gulp. It is VERY IMPORTANT that all captures are rendered as thematic to the Super Mario World Universe of games and to the characters depicted. The animations must be of equal length, with attention to even lighting, high-detailed texture, and consistent to the overall theme. Do not make them overly violent, but rather comical, with suitable reactions, facial expression, etc."
