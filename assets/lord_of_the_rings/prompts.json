Aragorn (White King) approaches with And\u00faril raised, delivers a decisive sword strike, or calls upon the Army of the Dead. Arwen (White Queen) uses elven magic to bind enemies, or strikes with ethereal grace. Gandalf (White Bishops) unleashes blinding white light, staff strikes, or calls down lightning. Legolas (White Knights) fires precise elven arrows that find their mark, or performs acrobatic strikes. White Rooks: Towers unleash volleys of arrows or magical defenses. Hobbit Pawns: Sting glows blue, precise strikes, or clever tactical moves. Sauron (Black King): Dark magic blasts, overwhelming power, or the Eye's gaze. Witch-king (Black Queen): Morgul blade strikes, fell beast attacks, or dark sorcery. Saruman (Black Bishops): Dark magic, staff blasts, or corrupted power. Nazg\u00fbl (Black Knights): Terrifying charges, morgul blade strikes, or fell beast dives. Black Rooks: Dark towers unleash siege weapons or dark magic.

White King/Queen DYING: Noble sacrifice - falls with honor, light fades, but hope remains. Black King/Queen ATTACKING: Overwhelming darkness - dark magic surges, the Eye's power, corruption spreads. Black King/Queen DYING: Dark power fails - armor cracks, darkness recedes, evil defeated.
