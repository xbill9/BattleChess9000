  "board_desc": "\"A futuristic sci-fi checkerboard. The dark squares are deep space windows showing a hyper-realistic universe with distant stars, purple nebulae, and cosmic void. The light squares are industrial robot-factory floors made of brushed chrome, exposed circuitry, and glowing blue data lines. High contrast between the organic cosmic void and the structured mechanical metal. Top-down orthographic view, seamless texture, 8k resolution, photorealistic.\"",
  "piece_desc": "\"1950s Sci-Fi B-Movie Aesthetic. IF WHITE (The Robots): Retro-futuristic 'Forbidden Planet' style robots made of polished chrome, glass domes, and blinking lights. White Pawn: A clunky, boxy frontline 'tin man' robot. White Rook: A retro-silver rocket transport ship upright. White Knight: A robot lancer riding a mechanical quadruped steed. White Bishop: A robotic high-priest with a tesla-coil staff. White Queen: A sleek, feminine chrome android 'Maria from Metropolis' style. White King: A massive Supreme Leader robot with a radar-dish crown. IF BLACK (The Aliens): Gruesome 'Mars Attacks' style invaders with exposed brains and green skin. Black Pawn: A bug-eyed minion alien with a ray gun. Black Rook: A metallic flying saucer UFO hovering on landing gear. Black Knight: An alien warrior riding a terrifying organic spider-crab beast with a lance. Black Bishop: An Alien High Priest in strange robes holding a mystic artifact. Black Queen: A terrifying, slender Alien Matriarch. Black King: The Supreme Leader Alien with a cape and pulsating brain. RENDER STYLE: Studio model photography, high detail, sharp focus, contrasting materials (Chrome vs Slime).\"",
  "anim_desc": "\"1950s Sci-Fi Movie Special Effects style. White (Robots) vs Black (Aliens). Violent, campy, colorful, and destructive, like a high-budget B-movie finale. Standard Kills: Robots use lasers, mechanical crushing, or rocket exhaust. Aliens use green slime rays, brain blasts, or summoning tentacles. Rooks use death rays (UFO/Rocket). Knights trample enemies. ROYALTY LOGIC (Make these EPIC): 1. If King or Queen is ATTACKING: They use 'Ultimate Attacks'. The Robot King unleashes a massive chest-mounted disintegration beam or calls down an orbital laser strike. The Robot Queen uses high-speed plasma blades to slice the enemy into scrap. The Alien King uses telekinetic brain-waves to explode the enemy from the inside. The Alien Queen uses a sonic scream or tail-impale to obliterate the target. 2. If King or Queen is DYING: It must be a dramatic, slow-motion defeat. Robots spark violently, leak oil, short-circuit, and topple over like a fallen statue. Aliens screech in horror, dissolve into a puddle of bubbling green goo, or explode into visceral slime. Theme: High contrast, neon lasers, fog, and retro-futuristic destruction.\""
