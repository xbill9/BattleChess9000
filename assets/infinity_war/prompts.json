  "board_desc": "\"An ultra-premium 8\u00d78 chessboard perfectly centered in frame, shown in strict orthographic top-down view so every square is fully visible, unobstructed, and game-accurate. The board itself takes up most of the image, with a thin margin around it. The light squares are luminous Arc Reactor glass panels with subtle blue circuitry glowing beneath the surface; the dark squares are cracked voidstone obsidian infused with faint purple cosmic veins. Each square is perfectly aligned, crisp, and easy to read for gameplay.Outside the edges of the board, in the background only (never overlapping or covering any squares), the environment expands into a cinematic battlefield: behind the white home rank rises a sleek, MCU-inspired Avengers-style tower on a New York City skyline, lit with cool blue and white lights; behind the black home rank, far in the distance, sits a massive, ominous cosmic throne on a shattered asteroid plateau floating in deep space, surrounded by swirling nebulae and scattered debris. Along the far left and right edges of the frame, you can see hints of New York skyscrapers and city lights blending into the cosmic sky, but they always stay outside the main board area.Lighting is dramatic but functional: soft rim-lighting around the board edges, gentle reflections on the Arc Reactor glass squares, and a subtle cosmic glow from above. Resolution is ultra-sharp, 8k, photorealistic, with a faint aura of Infinity-Stone-style energy pulsing along the grid lines \u2014 but the 8\u00d78 board remains perfectly clean, flat, readable, and never obstructed by any background elements.\"",
